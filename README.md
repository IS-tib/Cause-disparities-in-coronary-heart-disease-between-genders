Overview
Limited studies have investigated the differences between the causes of coronary heart disease (CHD) in men and women. While some research focuses on one gender, few studies have examined how common risk factors vary in significance between the two. This study aims to bridge that gap by analyzing gender-based differences in CHD risk using data from the Framingham Heart Study, a long-term cardiovascular cohort study of Framingham, Massachusetts residents.

Methodology
A variety of factors were considered in assessing CHD risk, including:
- Gender
- Age
- Previous medical history
- Lifestyle factors (e.g., smoking)
- Exploratory data analysis and regression analysis were employed to identify key risk factors and their varying impact on men and women.

Key Findings
Through regression analysis, clear distinctions between genders emerged:

Significant risk factors for men:
- Age
- Systolic blood pressure
- Total cholesterol
- Glucose levels
Significant risk factors for women:
- Age
- Systolic blood pressure
- Glucose levels
- Cigarettes smoked per day
- Previous history of hypertension
  
These findings highlight the importance of gender-specific considerations in assessing and preventing CHD.

Limitations & Future Research
While the Framingham Heart Study has provided critical insights, it has limitations in inclusivity. The early cohorts were composed predominantly of Caucasian participants, making it less generalizable to diverse populations. Future research should build upon these findings by incorporating more inclusive data and refining CHD risk assessment models for all demographics.
